# Cursed Castle 🏰
*Created with PICO-8 in pico-Lua for fun*

[Play the Demo](https://jerryi.github.io/pico-castle/)

**Cursed Castle** is my first attempt at creating a game (and pixel art) for the PICO-8 fantasy console, featuring dynamic lighting and a parallax background. *Don't expect much, it's just a few rooms*

### Controls
- **Z** — Jump
- **X** — Sword Attack
- **A** — Raise Shield

### Notes
Due to PICO-8’s 8K token limit, the game currently features three levels (or rooms). I’m continuing to optimize and we shalle see how far i can manage ;)
